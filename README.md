#Bootstrap - A base-theme for Backdrop ported from Drupal Bootstrap theme 7.x-3.0

1. This theme uses a CND for loading the Bootstrap Library.
2. Bootswatch support included. Easy to pick a Bootswatch free theme.
3. 

1. Bootstrap requires a minimum jQuery version of 1.7 to function properly. You must download and enable the ![jQuery Update](http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update/) module, 7.x-2.3 version or higher. Navigate to the configuration page and ensure that the minimum version selected is 1.7.
2. By default, this base theme enables and uses a CDN for loading the Bootstrap library. If you disable this CDN, you will need to use an alternative solution for adding the necessary CSS and JS files from the Bootstrap library. This can be in the form creating a sub-theme or using a utility module.
