#Bootstrap - Backdrop theme 
*ported from [Drupal Bootstrap theme 7.x-3.0](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap)*

1. [BootstrapCDN](http://bootstrapcdn.com/) based.
2. [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com) support (via BootstrapCDN) included. Easy to pick a Bootswatch free theme.
3. Font awesome support included.
4. Other tweaks:
  - Navbar settings (fixed, static, top, bottom)
  - Navbar user menu with cog icon
  - Breadcrumbs tweaks
  - Content fluid or fixed width
  
## Excluded from code
  - Starter kit. But you still can create sub theme. See [Developing themes](https://api.backdropcms.org/developing-themes)
  - Tooltip. Feature is here, but you need follow [documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips) to make it work.
  - Popovers.  Feature is here, but you need follow [documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers) to make it work.
  - Anchors settings. I believe this one need to be done via module.

## Roadmap
  1.x-3.3.5.2
   - Tooltops, Popovers implementation in a best way to integrate with backdrop.
